Above is a comparison of a before and after lighthouse score from browser rendering to server-side rendering utilizing Angular Universal.  One of the main accomplishments as a senior full-stack developer was the entire migration of the monolith Angular application to use express to render html on a cloud server and send to end user.  This architectural change was even more impactful considering most South American visitors use mobile devices with slower connection speeds.

Not only did this drastically improve performance as seen above but this allowed Google's search bots to correctly crawl the index file of all 1000+ unique dealer sites by allowing JavaScript to render the SEO tags before being crawled.  This led to higher search index scores which lead to a drastic increase in site traffic and leads created for all South American dealerships, and increasing leads generated by two fold.

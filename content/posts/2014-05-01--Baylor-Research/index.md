Baylor’s Wireless and Microwave Communication Systems (WMCS) lab wanted a way to view three power amplifier design characteristics at the same time. Mr. Barkate created a software tool to autonomously data mine circuit simulations in order to create this new three-dimensional realization of the Smith Chart.

 With the use of the new graphing tool, the WMCS team was able to write and present multiple unique plots of difference power amplifier characteristics. Mr. Barkate then created a software communication tool to communicate between Advance Design Systems’ netlist files and MATLAB. This allowed for optimization of power amplifier circuitry in real time. Several research papers were then published using this automation technique and the WMCS team utilizes this tool for all current simulations.

For completion of Baylor's Master Of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Joseph completed a thesis covering methods of optimizing a power amplifier through programmatic algorithms.  Through the thesis Joseph explains multiple algorithm methods and the advantages and pitfalls of each when searching through five-dimensional space.  This five dimension search space is depicted below with a grid of three dimensional graphs.  The fourth dimension is represented as the graphs move from the left to the right side of the page and the fifth dimension is described when the graphs are displayed from top to bottom.
